        <p>EUBUCCO is a scientific database of individual building footprints for 200+ million buildings across the 27
          European Union countries and Switzerland, together with three main attributes – building type, height and
          construction year – included for respectively 45%, 74%, 24% of the buildings. EUBUCCO is composed of 50 open
          government datasets and OpenStreetMap that have been collected, harmonized and partly validated.</p>
        <p>EUBUCCO provides the basis for high-resolution urban sustainability studies across scales – continental,
          comparative or local studies – using a centralized source and is relevant for a variety of use cases, e.g.
          for
          energy system analysis or natural hazard risk assessments.
