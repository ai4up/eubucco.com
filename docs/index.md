# Welcome to EUBUCCO

EUBUCCO is a scientific database of individual building footprints for 200+ million buildings across the 27 European Union countries and Switzerland, together with three main attributes – building type, height and construction year – included for respectively 45%, 74%, 24% of the buildings. EUBUCCO is composed of 50 open government datasets and OpenStreetMap that have been collected, harmonized and partly validated.
